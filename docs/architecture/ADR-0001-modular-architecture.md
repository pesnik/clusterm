# ADR-0001: Modular Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The original ClusterM application was implemented as a monolithic Python file (~1,200 lines) with all functionality in a single class. As the application grows and new features are added, this approach presents several challenges:

- **Maintainability**: Large files are difficult to navigate and modify
- **Testability**: Monolithic classes are hard to unit test in isolation
- **Extensibility**: Adding new features requires modifying core application code
- **Code Reusability**: Components are tightly coupled and cannot be reused
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers cannot work on different features simultaneously

## Decision
We will adopt a modular, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Module Structure
```
src/
├── core/          # Core infrastructure (config, events, logging)
├── k8s/           # Kubernetes operations and management
├── plugins/       # Plugin system for extensibility
└── ui/            # User interface components
```

### Layer Responsibilities
1. **UI Layer**: Handles user interaction, display, and input validation
2. **Core Layer**: Provides infrastructure services (config, events, logging)
3. **Business Logic Layer**: Implements domain-specific functionality
4. **Integration Layer**: Interfaces with external systems (kubectl, helm, K8s API)

### Key Principles
- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Dependencies flow inward (UI → Core → Business Logic → Integration)
- Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Configuration and logging are centralized
- Events provide loose coupling between components

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Better Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and modify
- **Improved Testability**: Modules can be unit tested in isolation
- **Enhanced Extensibility**: New features can be added as plugins or new modules
- **Code Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the application
- **Team Scalability**: Multiple developers can work on different modules simultaneously
- **Clear Architecture**: Well-defined boundaries and responsibilities

### Negative
- **Initial Complexity**: More files and structure to understand initially
- **Potential Over-engineering**: Risk of creating unnecessary abstractions
- **Import Management**: Need to manage module dependencies carefully

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Keep Monolithic Structure
- **Pros**: Simple, everything in one place
- **Cons**: Poor maintainability, hard to test, difficult to extend

### 2. Microservices Architecture
- **Pros**: Maximum modularity, language flexibility
- **Cons**: Over-engineered for a TUI application, unnecessary complexity

### 3. Package-based Organization
- **Pros**: Simple organization
- **Cons**: Doesn't enforce architectural boundaries as well

## Implementation Details

### Module Dependencies
```python
# Core modules (no external dependencies within src/)
src.core.config
src.core.events
src.core.logger
src.core.exceptions

# Business logic (depends on core)
src.k8s.manager (uses core.config, core.events, core.logger)
src.plugins.manager (uses core.config, core.events, core.logger)

# UI (depends on core and business logic)
src.ui.app (uses core.*, k8s.manager, plugins.manager)
```

### Interface Definitions
Each module exposes clear interfaces through `__init__.py` files, hiding internal implementation details and providing stable APIs for other modules to use.

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual modules in isolation
- Integration tests for module interactions
- Mock external dependencies (kubectl, helm, K8s API)
- Test fixtures for common scenarios

## Migration Strategy
1. ✅ Create new modular structure
2. ✅ Migrate core functionality to appropriate modules
3. ✅ Update main.py to use new architecture
4. ✅ Add comprehensive tests
5. ✅ Update documentation
